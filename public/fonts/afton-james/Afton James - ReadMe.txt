A Font by S. John Ross

"Afton James" is the nickname of a mariner on heaven's grave (see Uresia: Grave of Heaven), who brags openly that his sheltered port is on the lost Isle of Afton. This font, named for him, is a full U.S. keyboard set with a couple of the usual extras and quite a lot of careful kerning, so please try it in kerning-supported software to see it at its best. Enjoy!
